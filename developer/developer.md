# Development Guide

This guide describes workflows and best practices for developers. If
you are a service developer, you will need to consult this guide and
the companion [Modeling Guide](../xos/README.md) that describes how
define models and synchronizers for services being onboarded into
CORD. If you are a platform developer, you will find information about
the platform services typically integrated into CORD (e.g.,
Kubernetes, OpenStack, VTN). Service developers may be interested in
what's under the covers, but they should not need to understand these
internals to develop individual services.
