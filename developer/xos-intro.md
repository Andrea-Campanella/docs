# Modeling Services

CORD adopts a model-based design, which is to say all aspects
of operating and managing CORD is mediated by a model-based
control plane. XOS is a tool that CORD uses to implement this
control plane. For an overview of XOS, see the [XOS page on the
CORD wiki](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/XOS+and+NEM).

XOS is a self-contained component of CORD, with its own
[Guide](https://guide.xosproject.org). Consult this Guide to learn how
to [use XOS](https://guide.xosproject.org/use.html) to write models
and synchronizers for CORD services. The Guide also describes how
to [install XOS](https://guide.xosproject.org/install.html) as a
stand-alone platform, which can be useful when developing models
and synchronizers.
