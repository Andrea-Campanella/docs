# Platform Services

Everything is a service in CORD, including the "platform" on top of
which other services run. This includes infrastructure services like
Kubernetes and OpenStack, SDN controllers like ONOS, and overlay
services like VTN. This section includes information about how these
platform-level services are integrated into CORD, and the role they play
in supporting other services.
