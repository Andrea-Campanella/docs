# Platform Services

In CORD, everything is a service, including the "platform" that provides
the substrate on top of which other services run. This includes infrastructure
services like Kubernetes and OpenStack, SDN controllers like ONOS, and
overlay services like VTN. This section includes information about how these
platform-level services are integrated into CORD, and the role they plan in
supporting other services.
