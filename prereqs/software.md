# Software requirements

CORD is distributed as a set of containers that can potentially run on any Kubernetes environment.

As such, you can choose what operating system to use, how to configure it, and how to install Kubernetes on it.

**M-CORD is the exception**, since part of its components still run on OpenStack. OpenStack is deployed as a set of Kubernetes containers. Anyway these containers require a special version of Kubernetes and additional configurations. You can find more informations about this in the M-CORD installation sections.

Following sections describe what specifically CORD containers require and some pointers to DEMO automated-installation scripts.
