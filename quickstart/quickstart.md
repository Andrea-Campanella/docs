# Quick Start

If you prefer to understand the installation process in more depth, including the full range of deployment options, you should start with the [Installation Guide](../README.md) instead.

There are two Quick Starts available.

* If you've met the hardware prerequisites and quickly want to get SEBA installed, use the [SEBA Quick Start](seba_quickstart.md). If you don't have the hardware, try [SEBA-in-a-Box](../profiles/seba/siab-overview.md).

* The other quick start helps you quickly understand the internal workings of the CORD platform - for example, how xproto, TOSCA and Helm all interact for a [simple example service](example_service_quickstart.md).
