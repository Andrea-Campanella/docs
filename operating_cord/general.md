# General Info

This section of the guide describes tools for interacting with CORD.
These tools generally interact with CORD over a variety of APIs that
are described [here](api.md). Most notably:

* A graphical interface is documented [here](gui.md).

* A command-line interface, [cordctl](/cordctl/README.md), can be used to interact
  with the CORD data model and perform high-level operations such as backup and restore.

* A text shell, [XOSSH](/xos/dev/xossh.md), can be used to operate on
  objects in the CORD data model.
