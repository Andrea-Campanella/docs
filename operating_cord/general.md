# General Info

This section of the guide describes tools for interacting with CORD. These tools generally interact with
CORD over a variety of APIs that are described [here](/api/api.md). Most notably:

* A graphical interface is documented [here](gui.md).

* A text shell, [XOSSH](/xos/dev/xossh.md), can be used to operate on objects in the CORD data model.
