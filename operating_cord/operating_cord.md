# Operations Guide

This guide defines various processes and procedures for operating a
CORD POD. It assumes the [install](../README.md) is already
complete, and you want to operate and manage a running POD.

Today, CORD most often runs for demo, development, or evaluation
purposes, so this guide is limited to simple procedures suitable for
such settings. We expect more realistic operational scenarios will be
supported in the future.
