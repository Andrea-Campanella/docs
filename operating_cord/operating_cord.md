# Operations Guide

This guide defines various processes, procedures, and tools for
operating a CORD POD. It assumes the [install](../README.md) is
already complete, and you want to operate and manage a running POD.

Note that the first step in operating a POD is to provision and configure
the set of *Services* included in the selected *Profile*. Configuration
details are specified in the follow two References:

* [Configuring Profiles](../profiles/intro.md)
* [Configuring Services](services.md)

Default configurations are currently loaded into the POD at
installation time.
