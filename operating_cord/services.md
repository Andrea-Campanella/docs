# Service Reference

Each release of CORD includes a collection of services, some of which
are considered *platform services* (i.e., configured into all profiles) and
some of which are *profile-specific*.  The following documents the
available services, specifying how each is modeled using `xproto`, and
how each is configured and provisioned using TOSCA.
