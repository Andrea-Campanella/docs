# XOS Internals

XOS is the component of CORD that implements the control plane
through which operators control and manage CORD. This normally
happens through a set of XOS-generated [APIs](api.md).

This section describes XOS internals, including how it is configured and
deployed on a running POD. Additional information about how to write
XOS models (from which these interfaces are generated) is
described a separate [XOS Guide](https://guide.xosproject.org).
