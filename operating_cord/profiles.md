# Configuring Profiles

Configuring and provisioning profiles involves creating the service
graph that is to run on a POD, and provisoning the resources (e.g.,
compute instances and networks) that are to run those services. This
is typically done using a TOSCA workflow. This section documents
example TOSCA workflows for the R-CORD and M-CORD profiles.
