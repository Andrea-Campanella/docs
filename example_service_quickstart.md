# ExampleService Quick Start

This section walks you through an example installation sequence on two different Unix-based platforms. This is just a surface introduction to CORD. If you prefer to understand the installation process in more depth, including the full range of deployment options, you should start with the [Installation Guide](README.md) instead.

This Quick Start describes how to install a subset of the CORD platform, plus a `SimpleExampleService`, on a single machine. Once you complete these steps, you might be interested in jumping ahead to the [SimpleExampleService Tutorial](simpleexampleservice/simple-example-service.md) to learn more about the make-up of a CORD service. Another option would be to explore CORD's [operational interfaces](operating_cord/general.md).
