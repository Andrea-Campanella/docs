# SEBA-in-a-Box Overview

If you do not have the [prerequisite hardware](../../prereqs/hardware.md) to
install SEBA we have you covered. You can get a complete CORD system together
with the CORD platform, a profile such as SEBA, an exemplar operator workflow and
an emulated data-plane using SEBA-in-a-Box.

There are two ways to get started with SEBA-in-a-Box (SiaB). If you want to emulate
the access network (OLTs and ONUs) as well as the Aggregation switch in software,
use [SiaB](./siab.md).

If you want to emulate **just** the access network (OLTs and ONUs) but connect it
to a physical AGG switch (sometimes called a Fabric switch), use
[SiaB-with-fabric-switch](./siab-with-fabric-switch.md)
