# Quick Start

This section walks you through an example installation sequence on two
different platforms. If you'd prefer to understand the installation
process in more depth, including the full range of deployment options,
you might start with the [Installation Guide](README.md) instead.

This Quick Start describes how to install the R-CORD profile, plus a
`SimpleExampleService`, on a single machine. Once you complete these
steps, you might be interested in jumping ahead to the
[SimpleExampleService Tutorial](simpleexampleservice/simple-example-service.md)
to learn more about the make-up of a CORD service. Another option
would be to explore CORD's [operational interfaces](operating_cord/general.md).
